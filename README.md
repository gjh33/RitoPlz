RitoPlz is an independently developed easy to use API wrapper for Riot Games API.
The main goal of this project is to provide a very clean, easy to use API which should not result in any frustration. Should you find yourself frustrated please open a Bug Report so I can make the necessary changes. The source code should also be simple and easy to read.
